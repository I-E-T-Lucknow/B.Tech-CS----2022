### Market Basket Analysis using R 
Market basket analysis is a way to delve into the data that merchants use to understand customers behavior better so they can enhance their sales. Market basket analysis is a well-known and widely used method used by large retailers to emphasize relationships between products such as bread and butter. It works by looking for product combinations that sometimes appear in the transaction. To see it from a different perspective, ask the 
trader to look at the relationships between individual purchases. With the continued growth of information technology, companies are collecting and storing large amounts of data. This includes analysis of large datasets such as B. Purchase history, product group identification, and products that can be bought together.
