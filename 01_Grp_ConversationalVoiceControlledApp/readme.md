Voice Controlled Apps

This project instantiates a conversational voice controlled app with authentication written in react and driven by Artificial Intelligence to provide the user with an interactive experience. The app is built in node.js runtime environment, using express for server side utilities and a NoSQL database(MongoDb) for storage and horizontal scaling. With react we've been able to provide a responsive user interface that would work across all devices. We’ve targetted building an application that is easily scalable for a large user mass.

This project gave us a first hand experience about AI, its numerous applications and how the technologies could be integrated into an application that serves multiple
purposes without us having to reinvent the wheel. We are highly indebted to Dr. Manik Chandra and Er. Pratibha Pandey for providing us valuable insights that was indispensable for the successful completion of the project.
