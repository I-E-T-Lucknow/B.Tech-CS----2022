# Facial Expression Recognition using CNN

Recognition of Facial expression in technology plays a major role in many sectors. It
has many advantages because of which it is very important. It is mainly used in market research
and testing. Many companies require a good and accurate testing method which contributes to
their development by providing the necessary insights and drawing the accurate conclusions.
Facial expression recognition technology can be developed through various methods. This
technology can be developed by using the deep learning with the convolutional neural networks
(CNN). The main objective here is to classify each face based on the emotions shown into seven
categories which include Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Sadness, Surprise and Neutrality. The
main objective here in this project is, to read the facial expressions of the people and displaying
them. OpenCV is used for automatic detection of faces and drawing bounding boxes around
them. Face detection using the Hear cascades is a machine learning based algorithm where a
cascade function will be trained with a set of input data. OpenCV contains many pre-trained
classifiers for face, eyes, smile etc. The deep learning is a subset of machine learning. Deep
learning is used by Google to translate the information form one language to another using deep
learning approach. The network should be trained with relatively more data in deep learning.

# Installation and Setup

1) Train the Model with Dataset FER-2013 jupyter Notebook (provided GPU in your PC) else use kaggle kernel or Google colab. Already trained Model is provided in the  repository by name - "FER_Model_Grp16.h5"

2) Install editor Pycharm then install/import in main.py following after creating virtual environment: Python 3.7 & Tensorflow 2.7.0 using pip.

3) Many Modules pre-installed in Python 3.7 like opencv-python, numpy and in tensorflow like keras (within keras various function will be used).

4) Download file "haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml" from repository for face detection.

5) Download "FER_Model_Grp16.h5" from repository for facial expression recognition.

# Run Project

Keep "FER_Model_Grp16.h5", "haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml" and "main.py" in same directory.
Run project with help of main.py after installing all required packages mentioned above.
